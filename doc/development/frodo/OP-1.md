OP-1: Set up build system (0.5 story point)
===========================================

To finish this story I plan to crib my Cmake file from the old version
of olympus. I might make some small changes to it depending on my current
needs, but I suspect this will be relatievly simple.

On second thought, I'm going to look at an example from OGRE or HOARD (
https://github.com/horde3d/Horde3D) and see if I can't improve my structure.

I'm not sure where I should put linking dependencies... Perhaps I can 
tag this for later investigation.
